(defun casual-calc-datafile-to-matrix (filename)
  "Read data in FILENAME into a matrix list.

This command reads a data file into a matrix list that can be
processed by Calc.

This matrix list is an Elisp list of lists where each list
element holds a value from a line from the data file. The
elements of this matrix list correspond in order to each
successive line in the data file. The general form of this list
is: ((a0 b0 c0 …) (a1 b1 c1 …) (a2 b2 c2 …) …), where a𝑛, b𝑛, c𝑛
are the data values in a line (or row) and 𝑛 is the row index in
the data file. The type of a𝑛, b𝑛, c𝑛 are determined by the Calc
function `math-read-number-simple'.

Data in the file are separated using the following regexp: \"[ \\f\\t\\v,]+\"
This regexp accepts the following separators:
- space
- tab
- comma
- formfeed character
- vertical tab"
