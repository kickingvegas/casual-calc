  "Raise a number 𝑦 to a power 𝑥.
\nIf the power is an integer, an exact result is computed using
repeated multiplications. For non-integer powers, Calc uses
Newton's method or logarithms and exponentials. Square matrices
can be raised to integer powers. If either argument is an
error (or interval or modulo) form, the result is also an
error (or interval or modulo) form.

(defun casual-calc--abs ()
  "Compute the absolute value of a number.
\nThe result is always a nonnegative real number: With a complex
argument, it computes the complex magnitude. With a vector or
matrix argument, it computes the Frobenius norm, i.e., the square
root of the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the
elements. The absolute value of an error form is defined by
replacing the mean part with its absolute value and leaving the
error part the same. The absolute value of a modulo form is
undefined. The absolute value of an interval is defined in the
obvious way.

  "Compute the factorial of the number at the top of the stack.
\nIf the number is an integer, the result is an exact integer. If
the number is an integer-valued float, the result is a
floating-point approximation. If the number is a non-integral
real number, the generalized factorial is used, as defined by the
Euler Gamma function. Please note that computation of large
factorials can be slow; using floating-point format will help
since fewer digits must be maintained.
