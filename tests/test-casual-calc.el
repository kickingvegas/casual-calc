;;; Commentary:

;; Test suite for Casual package.

;; Note that tests are focused on verifying UI behavior and not intended to test
;; the `calc' package.

;; * Running the test suite

;; ** Command Line
;; Casual uses `ert' to manage its test suite. The test suite is intended to be
;; run in batch mode via a Makefile in the same directory as this file.
;; Invoke the following command in a shell to run the test suite.

;;     $ make tests

;; ** Interactive
;; Tests can be interactively run via `ert' by loading the following two files:
;; - casual-calc-test-utils.el
;; - test-casual.el

;; Refer to `ert' documentation for more detail on how use it.

;;; Code:
(require 'ert)
(require 'casual-calc)
(require 'casual-calc-test-utils)
